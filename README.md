# from_tuple

Derive `From` tuples for `struct`s  that have unique field types.  This
requires that the `struct` has unique types for all of it's fields.  Due to
that requirement, it is most useful for struct utilizing the [newtype] pattern
for its fields.

Find more information on the [`FromTuple` documentation page].

## Example

```rust
use from_tuple::FromTuple;

#[derive(FromTuple)]
struct Hello {
    message: String,
    time: i32,
    counter: usize
}

fn main() {
    let hello: Hello = (-42, "hi".to_string(), 0usize).into();

    assert_eq!(&hello.message, "hi");
    assert_eq!(hello.time, -42);
    assert_eq!(hello.counter, 0);
}
```
